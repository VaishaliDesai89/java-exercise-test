  Scenario Outline: Search and verify results

    Given I am a non-registered customer
    And I navigate to "https://www.gov.uk/get-vehicle-information-from-dvla"
    #When I search for an item "<search_term>"
    #Then I get a list of matching results for "<search_term>"
    #And the resulting "<search_term>" items cards show: postage price, No of bids, price or show BuyItNow tag
    #Then I can sort the results by "<lowest_price_order>"
    #And the "<search_term>" results are listed in the page in the "Lowest price" order
    #Then I can sort the results by "<highest_price_order>"
    #Then I can filter the results by "Buy it now"
    #And all the "<search_term>" results shown in the page have the Buy it now tag

    Examples:
      | search_term |lowest_price_order|highest_price_order|
      |tea          |Lowest price      |Highest price      |
