# java-exercise-test

The technical test is divided into two parts. Hence, I created two separate projects java-test-1 and test within the same repository java-exercise-test

Configurations:
1. Eclipse IDE.
2. Maven project.
3. Uses Chrome browser as an MVP.
4. JUnit 

To Run:
1. java-test-1
  To run java exercise, please use TestSuite.java class as a runner for it. All methods are written in ScanFolder.java class and the output is visible directly on console.
  Path for the runner is /java-test-1/src/junitgrouptest/TestSuite.java
  Xls and CSV data files are at /Users/vdesa4/java-exercise-test/java-test-1/src/vehicle-information
2. test
The second part is selenium exercise, and to run that project please use TestRunner.java as a runner. 
Path for the runner is /test/src/main/java/selenium/test/TestRunner.java
